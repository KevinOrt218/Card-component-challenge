## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With the completion of this project I learned how to center a div horizontally and vertically. Flexbx offers a quick and easy way to center a div, using the align-items property to align the container on the transverse axis and using jistify content to align it on the main axis.

```css
.contenedor-flex {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh;
}
```


### Continued development

For future projects I would like to experiment with another layaout model as a grid for the positioning of the items, I would also like to investigate and apply animations in css to add more customization.

### Useful resources

- [Basic concepts of flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This helps me understand how flexbox works as an alternative to the two-dimensional grid model. Flexbox is a one-dimensional model that helped me to distribute the spacing between the component items and improve the alignment between them.
